## rotate

A CLI that lets you experience **modern monorepo** project quickly and easily, powered by [turborepo](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo), [pnpm](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm) and [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).

## Install

Install it globally:

```bash
pnpm add rotate -g
# Or Yarn
yarn add rotate -g
# Or npm
npm i rotate -g
```

You can also install it locally in your project, but it's not recommended, because it's not inconvenient to use `rotate new [project]` command.

## Command

Overview:

- [`rotate new`]()
- [`rotate add`]()
- [`rotate publish`]()
- [`rotate run`]()
